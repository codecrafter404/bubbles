# Bubbles - The shopping system for school events
This is a shopping system desinged for school events, like selling cake on a cake bazaar.
## Principles
- Creators: are taking an order (they have customer contact)
- Fulfillers: are fulfilling the order (like getting the cake ready, poor in the coffee, ...)

=> We found this system workes really reliably, especially whith great demand
### Creators
![](readme/creators.png)
On the right hand side you will find the items in the current order and on the lefthand side you'll find the available items.<br/>
The navigation is as follows and requires a numblock (all keys are numpad keys):
- `8`: go up
- `6`: go right
- `2`: go down
- `4`: go left
- `/`: undo last order (will mark it as cancelled)
- `Enter`: add item to basket
- `-`: remove item from basket
- `0`: confirm/send order

After a order is confirmed the following screen will show you the order number; this is the right opportiunity to let the customer pay & to tell them the order number. After this press the confirm button again to create a new order.

### Fulfiller
![](readme/fulfill.png)
As soon as an order has been confirmed it will be shown to one of the fulfillers. They now can fulfill the order by pressing `0` or undo the last fulfillment by pressing `/`.<br/>
Once the order has been prepared, the fulfiller should tell the customer with the order number (just call the customer by him/her order id) and give them the order; then confirm it.

## Setup
As the software is in alpha the setup is a bit complex:
- Download & Extract the zip archive of the [releases](https://github.com/codecrafter404/bubbles/releases)
- Add your images (the food preview images) into the folder `app/images/`
- Start `bubble.exe`
- Navigate to `localhost:8080/config`
- Create a graphql mutation in order to add the available items with properties as follows: (see [here](https://github.com/codecrafter404/bubbles/tree/master/server/configs) for examples)
    - `id`: a unique internal id
    - `available`: wheather the item is currently available (useful if you have limeted amounts of items)
    - `identifier`: A String only shown to fulfillers, maybe useful if you have a large storage of different items
    - `name`: should be self explainatory
    - `image`: the images you previusly added are living under `/images/`; eg. `/images/0.png`
    - `isOneOff`: should be true (CustomItems are currently not implemented)
    - `price`: in â‚¬
- The clients should be in one network, therefore go to the ip of the host & <mark>set the wss and graph api hosts to match your ip addresses</mark> (under `<ip>:8080/#/`)
- From there just click on the links to get to the creation/fulfillment site & enjoy

## Build
- go into `server/` run `go build .`
- go into `bubbles-ui/` run `npm run build`
- move `server/bubble.exe` into a new dir
- copy the existing `app/` dir into the new dir
- copy the `bubbles-ui/dist/` items into the `folder/app/` & replace maybe existing files
- use the new dir to run the server

## State
- The app has already been used for a schoolevent but misses some features which i may add in the future (see Issue #5)
